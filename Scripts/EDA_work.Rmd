this will be a document for initial EDA work for the three questions

first I can read in the datasets from the csv files I saved them in from the wrangling step

```{r}
drafted_players_data <- read_csv("../Data/draftAndCareerData0506to1920.csv")

season_draft_data <- read_csv("../Data/seasonToDraftOrderData0809to1819.csv")

complex_team_season_data <-
  read_csv("../Data/teamSeasonDataComplex0809to1920.csv")
```
also need the tidyverse, as usual
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

I guess I'll focus on the subquestion involving predicting draft order from season performance

```{r}
season_draft_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = PTSperc, y = PickOrder)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
```
